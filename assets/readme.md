# _Website for a band_
----------
[View Project Here](#)

This is a website for a group named Oompah Brass. They are a five piece brass group whose varied gigs include regular residences, large oktoberfest events, weddings and corporate functions. Their show, which generally includes upbeat pop covers, is upbeat, energetic and fun, and I want to build a website that represents this. 

## User Experience (UX)
